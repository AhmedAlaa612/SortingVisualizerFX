# Sorting Techniques Visualizer with JavaFX

This Sorting Techniques Visualizer is a JavaFX application that allows you to compare the performance of three sorting algorithms: Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort. You can control the delay, adjust the size of the simulation, and choose between random order, sorted order, or reversed order for the input data. Additionally, the application provides information on sorting time, the number of comparisons, and the number of element interchanges.

## Features

- Visualize and compare Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort.
- Adjustable simulation delay and input size.
- Choose between random, sorted, or reversed order for input data.
- Display sorting time, number of comparisons, and element interchanges
